# MNIST using KNN

The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digit images and it is divided in 60,000 examples for the training set and 10,000 examples for testing. In many papers as well as in this tutorial, the official training set of 60,000 is divided into an actual training set of 50,000 examples and 10,000 validation examples (for selecting hyper-parameters like learning rate and size of the model). All digit images have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed size image of 28 x 28 pixels. In the original dataset each pixel of the image is represented by a value between 0 and 255, where 0 is black, 255 is white and anything in between is a different shade of grey.
